                I am currently studying Bachelors of Computer Science at 
                <!--https://www.dal.ca/-->
                <a href="https://www.dal.ca/">Dalhousie University</a>
                 , situated in Nova Scotia, Canada. Since I was little I was curious about the different componenets of computers and was constantly taking out parts from toys to see the differnet parts of the toys. As I grew, my interest also increased in computer. The first computer language I learned was Python. It was really easy to learn. Next I learned HTML and CSS. Last summer, I took on myself to create a clone of google as a project using HTML and CSS. You can view my project <a href = "projects.html">here</a><br>
                A side hobby that I really enjoy is photography and videography. You can look at some of the pictures and videos <a href = "gallery.html">here</a> that I took on my own and edited.
